                  Hi, I am Ahmet. I am a final year student at Konya Technical
                  University Computer Engineering Department. I have been
                  studying on front-end development websites and mobile
                  applications. The risen I work in theese fields is I think I
                  can develop platforms that can solve problems of people in
                  daily lives. I love learning and share what I have learnt.
                  That's why I created a{" "}
                  <span className={styles.blogLink}>
                    {" "}
                    <Link href="https://www.betikblog.com/">
                      <a target="_blank">blog</a>
                    </Link>{" "}
                  </span>{" "}
                  website where we periodically share what we learnt with my
                  friends. I enjoy developing open source projects. If you want
                  to see my projects, you can view my github profile by clicking
                  the button below. I spend my free time playing instruments and
                  reading poetry. In this way, I both have a pleasant time and
                  increase my productivity. You can use the buttons below to
                  contact me.
