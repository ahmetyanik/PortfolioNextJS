                  I have been involved in software development for about three
                  years. During this time, I usually worked on programming of
                  websites and mobile applications. I designed and developed
                  responsive, corporate websites for several company in many
                  sector. I created two blog sites with two different front-end
                  approach for gain more experience about browsers and data
                  transportation. I also worked on mobile application
                  development. I attended a software camp about flutter in
                  2020's semester break. After semester break I took small
                  assignments in a mobile application project in the IT
                  department of Konya Technical University. I consider learning
                  as an endless highway. And I structure my work within this
                  perspective.
